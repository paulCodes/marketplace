# Tab PR Review

Multi-agent PR review pipeline with voice-controlled comment posting. Two modes: **dashboard** (no args) and **review** (PR URL or number from dashboard).

---

## Mode Detection

| Input | Mode |
|-------|------|
| No arguments | Dashboard: show all open PRs |
| PR URL (`https://github.com/...`) | Review that PR |
| Number from dashboard (e.g. "3") | Review that PR from the dashboard list |

---

## Dashboard Mode

When invoked with no arguments:

1. Fetch all open PRs across repos using `gh pr list --repo {repo} --state open --json number,title,author,headRefName,createdAt,reviewRequests`
2. Group by repo
3. Number rows **sequentially across all repos** so the user can say "review #3"
4. Sort by age (oldest first) within each group
5. Show: `#`, PR number, title (truncated to 60 chars), author, branch, age in days

```
## open-source/repo-alpha

| # | PR   | Title                        | Author  | Branch              | Age |
|---|------|------------------------------|---------|---------------------|-----|
| 1 | #142 | Add webhook retry logic      | alice   | webhook-retry       | 12d |
| 2 | #145 | Fix tenant isolation bug     | bob     | fix-tenant-iso      | 3d  |

## open-source/repo-beta

| # | PR   | Title                        | Author  | Branch              | Age |
|---|------|------------------------------|---------|---------------------|-----|
| 3 | #89  | Migrate to Kysely            | carol   | kysely-migration    | 7d  |
```

After displaying, offer: "Pick a number to review, or paste a PR URL."

Also check for stale review state files in `notes/pr-reviews/` (reviews saved but never posted). If found, offer to clean them up or resume.

---

## Review Pipeline

### Step 1: Check for In-Progress Review

Review state is saved to `notes/pr-reviews/{repo}-{pr_number}.md` with YAML frontmatter.

If a saved review exists:
- If `status: posted` -- start fresh
- If `status: findings_ready` or `status: drafting` -- offer to resume or start fresh
- On resume: always re-run context gathering to account for new commits

Track `head_sha` in state so you can detect if the PR has new commits since the review started.

---

### Step 2: Context Gathering (parallel)

Save the current branch before doing anything:
```bash
ORIGINAL_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

Run all of these in parallel:
- Fetch PR metadata (title, description, author, base/head branch, head SHA) via `gh pr view`
- Fetch changed files with diffs via `gh pr diff`
- Fetch inline review comments via `get_pull_request_comments` MCP tool
- Fetch conversation comments via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments`
  - **Two APIs needed.** Inline comments and conversation comments are separate. Most human feedback lives in conversation comments. Skipping the second call means missing context already discussed.
- **Tab project lookup**: Search `mcp__tab-for-projects__list_projects()` for a project matching the PR title, branch name, or description keywords. If found, load the project's tasks (`list_tasks({ project_id, status: "done" })` and `list_tasks({ project_id, status: "in_progress" })`) to get acceptance criteria. Pass these to the Acceptance QA agent in Step 3.

After metadata returns (provides the branch name), checkout the PR branch:
```bash
gh pr checkout {pr_number}
```

**Show existing comments** to the user before launching review agents so they see what has already been discussed.

**Backport detection:** If the PR targets a release branch (not main/master), this is likely a backport. Check `notes/pr-reviews/` for a prior review of the same work (match by ticket key from PR title or branch name). If found, offer:
- **Skip** -- already reviewed on the original PR
- **Quick diff** -- compare cherry-pick drift only (what changed between the original and backport)
- **Full review** -- treat as new

---

### Step 3: Launch Review Agents (parallel)

Launch 5-7 agents in parallel. Each receives the **full diff inlined in its prompt** so agents do not need to run git commands to find changed code. They CAN read additional files for surrounding context.

**For large diffs (>200KB):** split files across agents by domain instead of duplicating the entire diff to every agent.

#### Agent lineup

1. **Edge Case QA** -- boundary conditions, null handling, race conditions, async edge cases, error paths. Thinks like a breaker.

2. **Acceptance QA** (HIGHEST PRIORITY) -- verify PR description claims match actual code. Trace data flow. Check for `.map()` stale state bugs, `Promise.all()` over shared state, upsert logic that drops fields, tests that only use 1 item per key. Check test coverage of real data shapes. When Tab project context is available, verify code against Tab task acceptance_criteria (not just PR claims).

3. **Researcher** -- git blame on modified sections, prior PRs that touched these files, history patterns, TODO/FIXME that should have been addressed. Uses git history, not just the diff.

4. **Code Reviewer** -- CLAUDE.md standards compliance. Read the repo's CLAUDE.md first. Only flags violations of explicitly stated rules. Never invents rules that do not exist.

5. **Code Smells** -- Fowler catalog: long methods, feature envy, data clumps, excessive coupling, primitive obsession, complex conditionals. Skips test files (different design constraints apply).

6. **Test Reviewer** (conditional, only if test files in changeset) -- hollow assertions, over-mocking, bloated permutation tests, AI-generated test smells, mock leak, testing the wiring.

7. **Dynamic Specialists** (conditional, only when relevant):

| Artifact | Trigger | Focus |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Claude/AI skill files | Any SKILL.md or agent definition added/modified | Trigger accuracy, codebase correctness, drift from actual code |
| DB migrations | Any migration file | Schema safety, rollback plan, data loss risk |
| CI/CD config | Any workflow file | Correctness, security, performance |
| Docker/infra | Dockerfile, compose files | Security, layer efficiency, env leaks |

#### Agent output format

Every agent returns structured findings:
```
[file.ts:42] [severity: critical|high|medium|low] Description
-> Suggested fix: ...
```

Plus a `NICE` category for positive observations worth calling out in the blurb.

---

### Step 4: Consolidate Findings

1. Collect all findings from all agents
2. **Deduplicate** findings at the same file:line from different agents (keep the higher severity, merge descriptions)
3. **Sort:** critical > high > medium > low > NICE (positive observations)
4. Present as a numbered table:

```
| #  | Sev      | File            | Line | Agent          | Description                    |
|----|----------|-----------------|------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1  | critical | service.ts      | 42   | Edge Case QA   | Unhandled null in upsert       |
| 2  | high     | controller.ts   | 18   | Acceptance QA  | Missing validation on input    |
| 3  | medium   | repository.ts   | 93   | Code Reviewer  | Violates naming rule in CLAUDE |
| 4  | low      | helpers.ts      | 7    | Code Smells    | Feature envy on config object  |
| 5  | NICE     | test/service.ts | --   | Test Reviewer  | Great edge case coverage       |
```

Save findings to `notes/pr-reviews/{repo}-{pr_number}.md` with `status: findings_ready`.

---

### Step 5: Walk Through Findings ONE AT A TIME

Before starting the walk-through, update the review state file status to `drafting`.

**Do NOT batch all findings and ask "which ones do you want?"** Present each finding individually.

For each finding:
1. Show the finding: number, severity, file, line, agent, full description
2. Ask: **comment**, **skip**, or **tweak**?
3. If comment: draft the comment text using the voice rules below. Show the draft.
4. Wait for user approval, edits, or "skip"
5. Move to the next finding

**Why one at a time matters:**
- Some findings should be combined into one comment
- Related findings should cross-reference each other ("Similar theme to the credential table comment")
- Some findings are already covered by another comment's fix
- The user might want to escalate a nit to medium, or downgrade a medium to nit
- Pre-existing issues need authorship context (git blame) before framing

---

### Step 6: Draft the Review Batch

**This step MUST happen in the main context, not a sub-agent.** Voice consistency requires human-in-the-loop drafting.

After walking through all findings, present the complete batch:

**Top-level blurb:**
- 2-3 sentences calling out what the PR does well (specific, not generic)
- Set tone for inline comments: "Left a couple small thoughts inline" or similar
- Praise goes here, not in inline comments (praise-only inline comments are clutter)
- If any findings reference code OUTSIDE the diff, include them here with clickable permalink links

**Approved inline comments** in a table:
```
| # | File:Line          | Comment text (truncated preview)     |
|---|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | service.ts:42      | This upsert doesn't handle the ca... |
| 2 | controller.ts:18   | The input validation here misses...  |
```

**Body-only comments** (for lines outside the diff):
- Include GitHub permalink: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{head_sha}/{path}#L{line}`
- Every finding in the blurb MUST include a clickable link. Never reference "line ~93" without a link.

---

### Step 7: Post After Explicit Approval

**Never post without the user saying "post" or "go."**

Show the full draft one more time. Ask: "Good to post? You can also edit any comment."

If the user wants edits: apply them, re-present, ask again.

After approval, ask: **Approve** this PR, or just leave a **comment**?
- Comment only: `event: COMMENT`
- Approve: `event: APPROVE`

**Use Python for the payload** (shell escaping with markdown is fragile):

```python
import json

payload = {
    'event': 'COMMENT',  # or 'APPROVE'
    'body': '''Top-level blurb text here''',
    'comments': [
        {
            'path': 'path/to/file.ts',
            'line': 42,
            'side': 'RIGHT',
            'body': 'Inline comment text here'
        },
    ]
}

with open('/tmp/pr-review.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(payload, f)
```

Then post:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews --method POST --input /tmp/pr-review.json
```

**Line placement rules:**
- If the finding's line is IN the diff: post as inline comment using `line` + `side: "RIGHT"`
- If the finding's line is OUTSIDE the diff: put it in the review body with a clickable permalink
- Do NOT use `position` (deprecated diff-relative counting)
- For new files, the diff position = file line number + 1 (the @@ header is position 1)
- For multi-hunk files, positions count continuously across all hunks. If unsure, put it in the body with a permalink instead of guessing wrong.

Clean up temp files after posting. Update review state to `status: posted`.

---

### Step 8: Restore Original Branch

**This step runs ALWAYS** -- after posting, after a failed post, or if the user skips posting. Never leave the user on the PR branch.

```bash
git checkout {ORIGINAL_BRANCH}
```

---

## Voice and Tone Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. Every comment posted on behalf of the reviewer MUST follow them.

### Tone

- Write like a teammate, not a report generator or a linter
- Lead with the observation. No greetings, no hedging preamble.
- "nit:" prefix already signals low pressure. No need to add disclaimers.
- Frame feedback as observations: "I don't think there's a `direct/` subdirectory" NOT "you should fix this path"
- Contractions are fine and sound more human ("don't", "isn't", "won't")
- "Would it be worth..." is fine for suggestions, but don't overuse hedging language
- When findings relate to each other, cross-reference: "Similar theme to the credential table comment"
- Offer concrete suggestions: code examples, specific alternatives, renamed values
- Don't reference internal standards documents or style guides. Frame as personal observations.

### AI Tells to AVOID

These are dead ringers for AI-generated text. Humans WILL notice.

- **Em dashes**: The #1 AI tell. NEVER use them in comment text. Use periods, commas, or restructure the sentence.
- **"Hey!" openers**: Every AI code review starts with this. Don't.
- **"Just wanted to flag"** / **"Just thinking out loud"** / **"Just a heads up"**: Filler that screams AI.
- **"Not blocking!" / "Totally not blocking"**: If it's a nit, the prefix says it. No disclaimer needed.
- **Walls of text**: Break into short paragraphs. 1-2 sentences each.
- **Lecture-style explanations**: You're commenting, not teaching a class.
- **"you should" / "this needs to"**: Commanding language. Rephrase as observations or questions.
- **No cheesy encouragement**: "Could be a nice boy scout opportunity" sounds terrible.

### Comment Structure

Every comment follows: **(1) what's wrong > (2) why it matters > (3) suggested fix**

Bad:
> Hey! Just wanted to flag that this TODO looks like it might be stale -- the severity mapping was implemented in this PR so the tests should pass. Not blocking, but might be worth removing it so future developers don't get confused by it.

Good:
> This TODO looks stale now. The severity mapping landed in the same PR (`mapAppSecFindingSeverity` reads from `finding.severity`), so these assertions should pass. Might want to just pull this comment out so nobody down the road reads it and assumes these tests are expected to fail.

### Authorship Context

Before commenting on pre-existing issues, **check git blame**:

1. If the PR author also wrote the pre-existing code: "while you're in here" framing is fair game
2. If they did NOT write it: "Not from this PR, but..." framing, suggest as a follow-up
3. Never pressure people to fix other people's messes in their PR

### Grouping and Skipping

- If multiple findings make the same point, comment on the best example and skip the rest
- If a finding is covered by another comment's fix, skip it
- When a PR introduces a pattern, look for a "theme" across findings. Call out the theme once rather than repeating N times.
- Check: would the user miss a finding if you skipped it? If fixing finding A naturally leads to discovering finding B, skip B.

### Top-Level Blurb

- Call out what the PR does well. Be specific, not generic. ("Love that you hit all the case variants" beats "great tests")
- Set the tone: "Left some thoughts below and a couple inline"
- Weave praise here, not in inline comments. Praise-only inline comments are clutter.
- If findings can't be posted inline (outside the diff), put them in the blurb with clickable permalink links

### Never Include

- AI attribution ("Generated with Claude Code" or any variant)
- Inline praise-only comments
- Lecture-style explanations
- Em dashes in running text

### Approval Comments

When approving a PR: body is signature approval emojis only. No other text.

## Review State Persistence

Save review state to `notes/pr-reviews/{repo}-{pr_number}.md`:

```yaml
---
repo: owner/repo
pr_number: 142
head_sha: abc123
status: findings_ready  # findings_ready | drafting | posted
reviewed_at: 2026-04-23T14:30:00
original_branch: main
---
```

Below the frontmatter, store the findings table and any approved comment drafts.

**On resume:**
- Re-fetch PR metadata to check for new commits (compare head SHA)
- If new commits since review: warn the user, offer to re-run agents or continue with stale findings
- Restore the findings walk-through from where it left off

---

## Backport Handling

If the PR targets a release branch (not main/master):

1. Detect as backport from the base branch name
2. Search `notes/pr-reviews/` for a prior review of the same ticket (match ticket key from PR title or branch)
3. If prior review found, offer:
   - **Skip** -- code was already reviewed on the original PR
   - **Quick diff** -- compare cherry-pick drift only (what changed between original and backport)
   - **Full review** -- treat as new, run the complete agent pipeline

Most backports should be "quick diff" to verify the cherry-pick is clean and no new code was added.

---

## Tab Integration

This command does NOT require a Tab project to run. It operates independently.

However, if a Tab project exists for the work being reviewed:
- Check for attached KB documents that provide context about the codebase area
- Note any Tab tasks related to the PR's changes
- After posting a review, optionally create a Tab task to track follow-up items identified during review

---
